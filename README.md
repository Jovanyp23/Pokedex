# Pokedex
About: A Pokedex app mainly written in Javascript that so far can take the number of a Pokemon and display it's name, type(s), and a visual Sprite. 
It works by using Axios to call an Existing API. This project is more intended for me to add on more functionality as I learn more about the visual side of
Javascript with this bootcamp I'm going through. 

Future Functionality: 
- A history of searches that stay on the app
- Visually give each search a card that is dynamically filled in and displayed
- More advanced animation upon returned searched
- Any other unique flourishes I can add
